## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

The NHL Stat Tracker is a python based application that pulls live and historical NHL data to give users quick insights, team standings, and game results. Whether you're a fantasy hockey fan, a data nerd, or just want to keep up with your favourite team, this tool makes it easy to access and visualize the information.
<br>
The NHL Stat Tracker is a personal project of mine that I enjoy working on and will continue to add features when I find the time. As of right now I am happy with the progress I have made but do have plans to add more in the future.
